**Neural Network**

**Deep learning** is a branch of machine learning which is completely based on artificial neural networks, as neural network is going to mimic the human brain so deep learning is also a kind of mimic of human brain. In deep learning, we don’t need to explicitly program everything. The concept of deep learning is not new. It has been around for a couple of years now. It’s on hype nowadays because earlier we did not have that much processing power and a lot of data. As in the last 20 years, the processing power increases exponentially, deep learning and machine learning came in the picture. A formal definition of deep learning is- neurons

**Deep Learning** is a subset of Machine Learning that is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multiple layers, also known as deep neural networks (DNNs). These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and they are designed to learn from large amounts of data in an unsupervised or semi-supervised manner.

Deep Learning models are able to automatically learn features from the data, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The most widely used architectures in deep learning are feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

**Feedforward neural networks (FNNs)** are the simplest type of ANN, with a linear flow of information through the network. FNNs have been widely used for tasks such as image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** are a special type of FNNs designed specifically for image and video recognition tasks. CNNs are able to automatically learn features from the images, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a type of neural networks that are able to process sequential data, such as time series and natural language. RNNs are able to maintain an internal state that captures information about the previous inputs, which makes them well-suited for tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and language translation.

Deep Learning models are trained using large amounts of labeled data and require significant computational resources. With the increasing availability of large amounts of data and computational resources, deep learning has been able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more.
