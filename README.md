** Neural Network **

A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor (network) made up of simple processing units (neurons). It has a natural propensity for:

storing experiential knowledge through learning

making it available for use (classification/prediction)

Neural network resembles the brain in two respects:

Knowledge is acquired by the network through a learning process

Interneuron connection strengths, known as synaptic weights, are used to store the acquired knowledge
